Water Leak Troubleshooting – Professional Guidance

Common leak locations:
- Bathroom ceilings
- Under sinks and basins
- Behind toilet cisterns
- Kitchen appliances (dishwasher, washing machine)
- Boiler overflow pipes
- Radiators and copper joints

Immediate steps:
1. Turn off the stopcock (usually under the kitchen sink).
2. Isolate the leaking appliance if possible.
3. Place a container or towels to reduce damage.
4. Do not turn on electricity near water.

Signs of hidden leaks:
- Damp or bubbling paint.
- Soft spots on ceilings.
- Mould smell.
- Increased water bill.

If water is dripping from a light fitting, switch off mains power immediately and call an electrician and plumber.
